# Advent of code

A repo where I host the different AOC challenges I try, some work, some don't

These coding challenges are a fun way for me to explore new languages and just try my hands on something that may not be easy.

I plan to do all the future challenges and will host them here

Theses solutions are by no means the best ways. Some might only work for my input sets, some might be slow.
