# Advent Of Code 2019

So I decided I was going to do the Advent of Code 2019 even tho I'm late because I didn't know it existed and I don't have anything better to do.

You can find the Advent Of Code website [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

## Language

I'm trying to learn Golang, so I'm doing this in Go.

I might do this in another language (probably rust because I want to try my hand at it) if I can.

I will try to participate in the next one, and might also do the 2018 one.
